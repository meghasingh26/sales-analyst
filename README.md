This repository contains a comprehensive Diwali Sales Analysis using data analysis techniques and popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and PandasThe analysis focuses on understanding sales trends, customer behavior and product performance during the Diwali festive season. The project includes several steps including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and visualization.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is the first step in the analysis to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships in the dataset. Through this, we can identify key insights, detect outliers, and formulate hypotheses. We performed various operations like-:
1. Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation to get an overall view of sales data.
2. Analyzing relationships between variables like product category, sales, and customer demographics.
3. deletion to handle missing values to ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

# Data Cleaning:
1. Identifying and removing duplicate entries to avoid skewing the analysis.
2. Imputing missing values or dropping rows/columns that are irrelevant to ensure the data remains consistent and reliable.

# Statistical Analysis:
In addition to visual exploration, we also performed some basic statistical analysis to draw conclusions from the data

# Insights -: we get from the graphs 

1. Gender: Women significantly outspent men in the sales period.
2.  Age: The 26-35 age group was the largest spending demographic, followed by the 36-45 and 18-25 age groups.
3. State: Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka were the top-performing states in terms of sales.
4. Marital Status: Married women were the primary contributors to sales.
5. Occupation: The IT sector, healthcare and aviation industries had the highest spending levels.
6. Product: Food, clothing & apparel and electronics & gadgets were the most popular product categories.


# Conclusion:
Through this analysis, we gained key insights into the behavior of customers during the Diwali festive season, including identifying top-selling products, .By leveraging powerful libraries like NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we were able to visualize and interpret the data effectively, enabling businesses to make informed decisions about inventory, marketing strategies, and pricing for future Diwali seasons.
